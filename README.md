# Iss-Class-Acitivity

The errors I identified are the == should be = in the first 2 lines of the defn
2 stars and not three

semicolon are missing in loop

defn print_narcis_numbers in the start while defining, but while calling in the last line, the function is print_narc_numbers

is_narcisssist in the 2nd function should be is_narc

the function call in the last line should be print_narcis
